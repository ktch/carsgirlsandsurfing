title: This is Like The Place Out Back by the Dumpster Where You Take a Break
---

At the Kitchen, we work on a lot of high-stakes, important things, and so we needed to make a place where we could take a break and just talk, joke around, and make stuff that doesn't have to be any good.

Cars, Girls, and Surfing dot com is that place. It's a domain that Zach has owned since he was in college and he always wanted to use it for something.

It's a Beach Boys reference. If you hate the Beach Boys, you can just leave here and go back to your cold, dark, wintery lair of sadness.
